%   Short summary  
%   -------------
%  
%   algorithm is an environment for writing algorithm in LaTeX2e.
%   Almost all is customizable. You can add keywords, change style, change the layout, ...
%   It provide macros that allow you to create differents sorts of key words, therefore a set of predefined key
%   word is gived.
%
%   IT should be used as follows
%
%   \begin{algorithm}
%       ...
%       ...
%   \end{algorithm}
%
%
%   IMPORTANT : each line MUST end with \;
%
%   Note that if you define macros outside algorithm environment they
%   are avaible in all the document and particulary you can use then
%   inside all algorithms without re-define them.
%  
%   an example:
%
%   \begin{algorithm}

%   History: 
%
%   - January 06 2013 - revision 5.0
%                     * CHANGE: SetKwSwith takes now 9 args: 9th arg is the same as
%                                previous 8th arg ('end of switch' keyword). New 8th arg is
%                                'end of case' keyword. This is due to change of release
%                                3.2 which introduce end after case block... as I never
%                                test with longend option, I never see that the 'end
%                                switch' used for case was not good.
%                     * CHANGE: when no end keyword is defined in a block macro, then
%                                algorithm2e does no more try to print it. So even with lined or noline
%                                option, no empty line is printed (before: a blank end was
%                                printed, so a blank line appeared)
%                     * Internal Change: add some internal function to improve readibility
%                                        (thanks to Philip K. F. H\ölzenspies)
%                     * ADD: Block markers. 
%                            You can now ask package to put begin and end keywords automatically at begin
%                            and end of blocks, it means each group of commands shifted and enclosed in
%                            braces.
%                            This is tricky to use but, combined with \SetStartEndCondition and
%                            redefinition of keywords, you should be abble to simulate any syntax. See
%                            examples in documentation where a generic example is derived in pseudo-code,
%                            python and C by keeping code and changing only style using block markers
%                            macros, \SetStartEndCondition and some redefinition of keywords.
%                            These new block markers macros are:
%                            - \AlgoDisplayBlockMarkers and \AlgoDontDisplayBlockMarkers
%                            - \SetAlgoBlockMarkers{begin marker}{end marker}
%                            - \BlockMarkersSty{text} and \SetBlockMarkersSty
%                            Note that a new option has also been added: displayblockmarkers
%                     * ADD: \leIf macro automatically defined by \SetKwIF: allow to define
%                            an if-then-else on a single line.
%                     * ADD: new macro \SetStartEndCondition{typo1}{typo2}{typo3} which
%                            sets typo around condition in For, If, Switch, Case and
%                            Repeat macros. First two are used around For, If, Swith
%                            conditions, First and third are used for Case and Repeat
%                            condition where condition ends the line. Default definition
%                            is \SetStartEndCondition{ }{ }{}. 
%                            A common alternative is \SetStartEndCondition{ (}{) }{)}
%                            Can also be used to remove space around condition, for
%                            example if you want python style commands:
%                            \SetStartEndCondition{ }{}{} and \SetKwFor{For}{for}{:}{}
%                     * ADD: new environment algomathdisplay which allow display math (like inside \[ \] or $$ $$) 
%                            handling end line and line number
%                     * ADD: new command \SetKwProg{Env}{Title}{is}{end} which defines a macro
%                            \Env{args}{text}. Env is a block with 'Title' (in \CapSty) at the beginning
%                            followed by args followed by 'is' then 'text' is put below inside a block ended
%                            by 'end'. If no 'end' is specified, nothing is written (no
%                            blank line is inserted). Useful to typeset function or prog for example:
%                            \SetKwProg{Fn}{Function}{is}{end} makes \Fn{afunc(i: int) : int}{return 0\;}                    
%                            writes: 
%                            Function afunc(i: int) : int is
%                            | return 0;
%                            end
%                            or \SetKwProg{Def}{def}{:}{} makes \Def{afunc(i: int)}{return 0\;} writes:
%                            def afunc(i: int):
%                            | return 0
%                            Tip: combine it with \SetKwFunction to write recursive function algorithm. With
%                            example above, you could define \SetKwFunction{\Afunc}{afunc} and then write:
%                            \Def{\Afunc{i:int}{\eIf{i>0}{\KwRet \Afunc{i-1}}{\KwRet 0\;}} that writes:
%                            def afunc(i: int):
%                            | if(i>0):
%                            |     return afunc(i-1)
%                            | else:
%                            |     return 0
%                            with appropriate typo.
%                     * ADD: option croatian: croation keywords (thanks to Ivan Gavran)
%                     * ADD: option ngerman: same as german option but so can be used with global option ngerman
%                            of babel
%                     * ADD: option spanish: Spanish support (thanks to Mario Abarca)
%                     * ADD: unterminated block: useful to add part separator that doesn't necessary need an end
%                            keyword.  
%                            Designed on the pattern of unterminated if (see \uIf macro) allowing to
%                            add a block that is not terminated by a keyword. Such block are defined in the same
%                            time as a block is defined by adding a macro beginning with u. So, for example,
%                            predefined \SetKwBlock{Begin}{begin}{end} defines now two commands:
%                            - \Begin{} as previously which print a begin - end block
%                            - \uBegin{} that defines a begin only block
%                     * FIX: problem when numbering line inside until condition of
%                            \SetKwRepeat macro: line number was not correctly aligned.
%                     * FIX: dotocloa option which was broken
%                     * FIX: uIf and uCase didn't have same behavior when used with
%                            noline, vlined or lined option. This is fixed. Side effect: no empty
%                            line after an uIf or uCase when used with options lined or vlined
%                     * FIX: a bug with Repeat Until command when use with side comment on Until
%                     * FIX: a bug with side text -- text put into () -- of command macro (SetKwIf and so on)
%                            which was always setting a ';' even after a \DontPrintSemicolon
%                     * FIX: a bug with hyperref and chapter definition (thanks to Hubert Meier)
%                     * FIX: bugs with l macro and side comment
%                     * FIX: revision number
%                     * FIX: fix non ascii character (utf8 not yet recognized by all latex engine)
%                     * FIX: fnum@algocf had an useless parameter which sometimes broke expansion and output an error
%                     * FIX: works now with multicol package
%
%   - december 14 2009 - revision 4.1
%                     * ADD: new command \SetKwHangingKw{Name}{text} (hanging indent with keyword): This creates a
%                            hanging indent much like \texttt{SetKwInput}, except that it removes the trailing `:'
%                            and does not reset numbering (thanks to Nathan Tallent)
%
%   - november 17 2009  - revision 4.00 -
%
%                      * CHANGE: IMPORTANT: some commands have been renamed to have consistent naming (CamlCase
%                                syntax) and old commands are no more available. If you doesn't want to change
%                                your mind or use old latex files, you can use oldcommands option to enable old
%                                commands back.
%                                text. Here are these commands:

%                                - \linesnotnumbered becomes \LinesNotNumbered

%                                - \restorecaptionofalgo becomes \RestoreCaptionOfAlgo
%                                - \restylealgo becomes \RestyleAlgo
%                                - gIf macros and so on do no more exist
%                      * NEW: - Compatibily with other packages improven by changing name of internal
%                               macros. Algorithm2e can now be used with arabtex for example, if this last is
%                               loaded after algorithm2e package.
%                      * ADD: - OPTION endfloat: endfloat packages doesn't allow float environment inside other
%                               environment. So using it with figure option of algorithm2e makes error. This
%                               option enables a new environment algoendfloat to be used instead of algorithm
%                               environment that put algorithm at the end. algoendfloat environment make
%                               algorithm acting as endfloat figures. This option requires endfloat packages.
%                      * ADD: - OPTION norelsize: starting from this release (v4.00), algorithm2e package uses
%                               relsize package in order to get relative size for lines numbers; but it seems
%                               that some rare classes (such as inform1.cls) are not compatible with relsize; to
%                               have algorithm2e working, this option makes algorithm2e not to load relsize
%                               package and go back to previous definition by using \scriptsize font for lines
%                               numbers.
%                      * ADD: - OPTION onelanguage: allow, if using standard keywords listed below, to switch
%                               from one language to another without changing keywords by using appropriate
%                               language option:
%                               . KwIn, KwOut, KwData, KwResult
%                               . KwTo KwFrom
%                               . KwRet, Return
%                               . Begin
%                               . Repeat
%                               . If, ElseIf, Else
%                               . Switch, Case, Other
%                               . For, ForPar, ForEach, ForAll, While
%                               .
%                      * ADD: - OPTION rightnl: put lines numbers to the right of the algorithm instead of left.
%                      * ADD:   new commands \setRightLinesNumbers and \setLeftLinesNumbers which sets the lines
%                               numbers to the right or to the left of the algorithm.
%                      * ADD: - new kind of keywords: KwArray used to define arrays:
%                               \SetKwArray{Kw}{array} defines an array keywords Kw called array and printed in
%                               DataSty style when call with \Kw. It can be used with one argument which
%                               denotes the element index: \Kw{n} prints array[n] with array in DataSty and n in
%                               ArgSty.
%                      * ADD/FIX: rules of ruled, algoruled, tworuled styles used rules of different sizes! This
%                                 is now fixed. Moreover size of the rules is now controlled by a length and so
%                                 can be customized by the user.
%                                 \algoheightrule is the height of the rules and can be changed via \setlength
%                                 \algoheightruledefault is the default height of he rules (0.8pt)
%                                 \algotitleheightrule is the height of the rule that comes just after the
%                                 caption in ruled and algoruled style; it can be changed via \setlength
%                                 \algotitleheightruledefault is the default height of this rules (0.8pt)
%                                 Thanks to Philippe Dumas who reports the bug and make the suggestion.
%                      * ADD: - \SetAlgoCaptionSeparator which sets the separator between Algorithm 1 and the
%                               title. By default it's ':' and caption looks like "Algorithm 2: title" but now
%                               you can change it by using for example \SetAlgoCaptionSeparator{.} which will
%                               give "Algorithm 3. title"
%                      * ADD: - \SetAlgoLongEnd and \SetAlgoShortEnd and \SetAlgoNoEnd commands which act as
%                               corresponding package options
%                      * ADD: - OPTIONS italiano and slovak as new language (thanks to Roberto Posenato and
%                               Miroslav Binas) 
%                      * CHANGE: - Fnt and Sty macro to have consistent use and naming (see below)
%                      * ADD: - \AlCapSty, \AlCapNameSty, \AlCapFnt, \AlCapNameFnt, \ProcSty, \ProcFnt,
%                               \ProcNameSty, \ProcNameFnt, \ProcArgSty, ProcArgFnt and corresponding "set macro" 
%                               \SetAlCapSty, \SetAlCapNameSty, \SetAlCapFnt, \SetAlCapNameFnt, \SetProcSty,
%                               \SetProcFnt, \SetProcNameSty, \SetProcNameFnt, \SetProcArgSty, \SetProcArgFnt which
%                               control the way caption is printed. Sty macro use command taking one parameter as
%                               argument, Fnt macros use directly command. In Fact caption is printed as follow:
%                               \AlCapSty{\AlCapFnt Algorithm 1:}\AlCapNameSty{\AlCapNameFnt my algorithm}
%                               By default, \AlCapSty is textbf and \AlCapFnt is nothing. \AlCapNameSty keep text 
%                               as it is, and \AlCapNameFnt do nothing also.
%                               You can redefine \AlCapFnt and \AlCapNameFnt by giving macro to \Set commands. For
%                               example, you can do \SetAlCapFnt{\large} to see Algorithm printed in \large font.
%                               You can redefine \AlCapSty, \AlCapFnt, \AlCapNameSty and \AlCapNameFnt with the
%                               corresponding \Set command. For the Sty commands, you have to give in parameter
%                               name of a macro (whithout \)  which takes one argument. For example,
%                               \SetAlCapFnt{textbf} defines the default behaviour. If you want to do more
%                               complicated thing, you should define your own macro and give it to \SetAlCapFnt or
%                               \SetAlCapNameFnt. Here are two examples:
%                               - \newcommand{\mycapsty}[1]{\tiny #1}\SetAlCapNameSty{mycapsty}
%                               - \newcommand{\mycapsty}[1]{\textsl{\small #1}}\SetAlCapNameSty{mycapsty}
%                               Or you can combine the two, for the last example you can also do:
%                               \SetAlCapNameSty{textsl}\SetAlCapNameFnt{\small}
%                               Thanks to Jan Stilhammer who gives me the idea of \AlCapNameFnt.
%                      * CHANGE \AlTitleFnt to match definition of all other Fnt macros and add a \AlTitleSty 
%                               macro (see below) . Now you set \AlTitleFnt by calling \SetAlTitleFnt with 
%                               directly a macro without parameter in argument:
%                               Example: \SetAlTitleFnt{\small} to set title in small font.
%                      * ADD: - \AlTitleSty and \SetAlTitleSty commands to set a style for title. These commands
%                               are defined from a macro taking the text in argument, as \textbf for example. 
%                               To set the TitleSty you have to give name of the macro (without the '\') 
%                               to \SetAlTitleSty. For example \SetAlTitleSty{textbf} to set \textbf style.
%                      * ADD: - new command \SetAlgorithmName{algorithmname}{list of algorithms name} which
%                               redefines name of the algorithms and the sentence list of algorithms. Second
%                               argument is the name that \autoref, from hyperref package, will use. Example:
%                               \SetAlgorithmName{Protocol}{List of protocols} if you prefer protocol than
%                               algorithm.
%                      * ADD: - new \SetAlgoRefName{QXY} which change the default ref (number of the algorithm) by
%                               the name given in parameter (QXY in the example). 
%                      * ADD: - new command \SetAlgoRefRelativeSize{-2} which sets the output size of refs, defined
%                               by \SetAlgoRefName, used in list of algorithms.
%                      * ADD: - two dimensions to control the layout of caption in ruled, algoruled and boxruled
%                               algorithms:
%                               - interspacetitleruled (2pt by defaut) which controls the vertical space between
%                                 rules and title in ruled and algoruled algorithms.
%                               - interspaceboxruled (2\lineskip by default) which controls the vertical space
%                                 between rules and title in boxruled algorithms.
%                               These two dimensions can be changed by using \setlength command.
%                      * ADD: - With the fix (see below) of procedure and function environments, a new feature has
%                               been added: the name of the procedure or function set in caption is automatically
%                               defined as a KwFunction and so can be used as a macro. For example, if inside a
%                               procedure environment you set \caption{myproc()}, you can use \myproc macro in you
%                               main text. Beware that the macro is only defined after the \caption!
%                      * ADD: - OPTION nokwfunc to unable the new feature described above in function and
%                               procedure environment. Useful if you use name of procedure or function that cannot
%                               be a command name as a math display for example.
%                      * ADD: - \SetAlgoNlRelativeSize{number} command which sets the relative size of line
%                               numbers. By default, line numbers are two size smaller than algorithm text. Use
%                               this macro to change this behavior. For example, \SetAlgoNlRelativeSize{0} sets it
%                               to the same size, \SetAlgoNlRelativeSize{-1} to one size smaller and
%                               \SetAlgoNlRelativeSize{1} to one size bigger
%                      * ADD: - \SetAlgoProcName{aname} command which sets the name of Procedure printed by
%                               procedure environment (the environment prints Procedure by default). Second
%                               argument is the name that \autoref, from hyperref package, will use.
%                      * ADD: - \SetAlgoFuncName{aname} command which sets the name of Function printed by
%                               procedure environment (the environment prints Function by default). Second
%                               argument is the name that \autoref, from hyperref package, will use. 
%                      * ADD: - \SetAlgoCaptionLayout{style} command which sets style of the caption; style must
%                               be the name of a macro taking one argument (the text of the caption). Examples
%                               below show how to use it:
%                               . \SetAlgoCaptionLayout{centerline} to have centered caption
%                               . \SetAlgoCaptionLayout{textbf} to have bold caption
%                               If you want to apply two styles in the same time, such as centered bold, you have
%                               to define you own macro and then use \SetAlgoCaptionLayout with its name.
%                      * ADD: - OPTION procnumbered: which makes the procedure and function to be numbered as
%                               algorithm
%                      * ADD: - OPTIONS tworuled and boxruled
%                               these are two new layouts: tworuled acts like ruled but doesn't put a line after
%                               caption ; boxruled surround algorithm by a box, puts caption above and add a line
%                               after caption.
%                      * REMOVE: - SetKwInParam has been deleted since not useful itself because of different
%                                macros which can do the same in a better and a more consistent way as
%                                SetKwFunction or SetKw.
%                      * FIX: - line number is now correctly vertically aligned with math display.
%                      * FIX: - references with hyperref. No more same identifier or missing name error. BUT now
%                               you must NOT use naturalnames option of hyperref packages if you do PdfLaTeX
%                      * FIX: - autoref with hyperref package (thanks to Jörg Sommer who notices the problem).
%                      * FIX: - titlenumbered was not working! fixed.
%                      * FIX: - Else(){} acted like uElse. Corrected.
%                      * FIX: - noend management: when a block was inside another and end of block was following
%                               each other, a blank line was added: it's now corrected.
%                      * FIX: - Function and Procedure environment was no more working as defined originally: the
%                               label was no more name of the procedure, it acts always as if procumbered option
%                               has been used.
%                      * FIX: - line numbers had a fixed size which can be bigger than algorithm text accordingly
%                               to \AlFnt set (see also new command \SetAlgoNlRelativeSize above)
%                      * FIX: - semicolon in comments when dontprintsemicolon is used.
%                      * FIX: - listofalgorithms adds a vertical space before first algo of a chapter as for
%                               listoffigures or listoftables
%                      * FIX: - listofalgorithms with twocolumns mode and some classes which don't allow onecolumn
%                               and so don't define \if@restonecol as prescribed in LaTeX (sig-alternate for
%                               example)
%                      * FIX: - algorithm2e now works with elsart cls and some more classes.
%                      * FIX: - blocks defined by SetKwBlock act now as other blocks (if for instance) and don't
%                               write end in vlined mode, instead they print a small horizontal line as required
%                               by the option.
%                      * FIX: - underfull hbox warning at each end of algorithm environment removed.
%
%                      * INTERNAL CHANGE: - short end keyword are deduce from long end keyword by keeping the
%                                           first one. Allows to avoid double definition.
%                      * INTERNAL CHANGE: - procedure, function and algorithm are now resolved by the same
%                               environment to avoid code duplication. 
%
%   - October  04 2005  - revision 3.9 -
%                      * ADD: - \setalcaphskip command which sets the horizontal skip before Algorithm: in caption
%                               when used in ruled algorithm.
%                      * ADD: - \SetAlgoInsideSkip command which allows to add an extra vertical space before and
%                               after the core of the algorithm (ie: \SetAlgoInsideSkip{bigskip}) 
%                      * CHANGE: - caption, when used with figure option, is no more controlled by algorithm2e
%                                  package and so follows the exact behaviour of figures. The drawback is that you
%                                  cannot change the typo with AlTitleFnt or CapFnt. The avantage is that if you
%                                  use caption package, it works.
%                      * FIX: - problem with numbering line and pdflatex
%                      * FIX: - error when algorithm2e package was used with beamer and listings together
%   - February 12 2005  - revision 3.8 -
%                      * FIX: - extra line with noend option.
%   - February 10 2005  - revision 3.7 -
%                      * ADD: - sidecomment: different macros allowing to put text right after code on the same
%                               line. They are defined in the same time comment macros are defined with a star
%                               after the macro name. By default comments are right justified but this can be
%                               change with appropriate option in the macro. Ex:
%                               . default: \tcc*{side comment}
%                               . same as previous: \tcc*[r]{side comment}
%                               . left justify: \tcc*[l]{side comment}
%                               . here: \tcc*[h]{side comment} don't put the end of line mark before
%                                       comment (; by default) and don't end the line.
%                               . flushed: \tcc*[f]{side comment} same as the precedent but right
%                                 justified
%                      * ADD: - OPTION scright (default): right justified side comments (side comments
%                               are flushed to the righr)
%                      * ADD: - OPTION scleft: left justified side comments (side comments are put right after the
%                               code line)
%                      * ADD: - \SetSideCommentLeft acts as scleft option
%                      * ADD: - \SetSideCommentRight acts as scright option
%                      * ADD: - block like macro side text: all macro defining a block allows now to put text right
%                               after key words by putting text into (). Done to be used with sidecomment macros,
%                               but all text can be used. 
%                               Ex: \eIf(\tcc*[f]{then comment}){test}{then text}(else side text){else text}
%                      * ADD: - OPTION fillcomment (default): end mark of comment is flushed to the right so
%                               comments fill all the width of text.
%                      * ADD: - OPTION nofillcomment: end mark of comment is put right after the comment.
%                      * ADD: - \SetNoFillComment acts as nofillcomment option.
%                      * ADD: - \SetFillComment acts as fillcomment option.
%                      * ADD: - OPTION dotocloa: which adds an entry in the toc for the list of algorithms. This
%                               option load package tocbibind if not already done and so list of figures and list
%                               of tables are also added in the toc. If you want to control which ones of the lists
%                               will be added in the toc, please load package tocbibind before package algorithm
%                               and give it the options you want.
%                      * FIX: - vertical spacing for uif macro with noend option
%                      * FIX: - all the compatibility problems between caption and other packages
%                      * FIX: - typographical differences between list of algorithms and other lists  when in
%                               report or book 
%
%   - January 24 2005  - revision 3.6 -
%                      * FIX: - vertical spacing and space characters at the beginning or end of comments.
%                               line numbers of comments not in the NlSty.
%                               Thanks to Arnaud Giersch for his comments and suggestions.
%                      * FIX: - Set*Sty macro: the styles defined was not protected and was modified by surrounding
%                               context. For example KwTo in a \For{}{} was in bold AND italic instead of just in
%                               bold.
%                      * FIX: - line number misplacement after \Indp
%
%   - January 21 2005  - revision 3.5 -
%                      * ADD: - hidden numbering of the lines. Lines are auto-numbered but numbers are shown only
%                               on lines you specify:
%                               * linesnumberedhidden option or \LinesNumberedHidden macro activate this
%                                 functionnality.
%                               * \ShowLn and \ShowLnLabel{lab} macros make the number visible on the
%                               line. \ShowLnLabel{lab} allows to set a label for this line. 
%                               Thanks to Samson de Jager who makes this suggestion and provides the macros.
%                      * ADD: - \AlCapFnt and \SetAlCapFnt which allow to have a different font for
%                               caption. Works like \AlFnt and \SetAlFnt and by default is the same.
%                      * ADD: - \AlCapSkip skip length. This vertical space is added before caption in plain ou
%                               boxed mode. It allows to change distance between text and caption.
%                      * FIX: - caption compatible with IEEEtran class. 
%                      * FIX: - some vertical spacing error with \uIf macros (Thanks to Arnaud Giersch)
%                      * FIX: - Procedure and Function: lines are also numbered like algorithms
%                      * FIX: - CommentSty was not used for Comments
%
%   - January 10 2005  - revision 3.4 -
%                      * FIX: - caption compatible with new release of Beamer class. 
%
%   - June 16 2004     - revision 3.3 - 
%                      * FIX: - Hyperlink references of Hyperref package works now if compiled with pdflatex 
%                               and [naturalnames] option of hyperref package is used.
%                      * FIX: - algorithm[H] had problem in an list environment - corrected
%                      * FIX: - interline was not so regular in nested blocks - corrected
%                      * ADD  - \SetVlineSkip macro which sets the vertical skip after the little horizontal 
%                               rule which closes a block in Vlined mode. By default 0.8ex
%
%   - June 11 2004     - revision 3.2 - AUTO NUMBERING LINES !!!
%                      * ADD: auto numbering of the lines (the so asked and so long awaiting feature)
%                             this feature is managed by 3 options and 3 commands:
%                             - linesnumbered option: lines of the algo are numbered except for comments and
%                               input/output (KwInput and KwInOut)
%                             - commentsnumbered option: makes comments be numbered
%                             - inoutnumbered option: makes data input/output be numbered
%                             - \nllabel{lab} labels the line so you can cite with \ref{lab}
%                             - \LinesNumbered make the following algorithms having auto-numbered lines
%                             - \linesnotnumbered make the following algorithms having no auto-numbered lines
%                      * Change: algo2e option renames listofalgorithms in listofalgorithmes
%                      * FIX: new solution for compatibility with color package, more robust and not tricky.
%                             Many thanks to David Carlisle for his advices
%
%   - June 09 2004     - revision 3.1 -
%                      * Change: \SetKwSwitch command defines an additionnal macro \uCase and \Case prints end
%                      * Change: now macros SetKw* do a renewcommand if the keyword is already defined. So you can
%                                redefine default definition at your own convenience or change your definition
%                                without introducing a new macro and changing your text.
%                      * ADD: new macro \SetKwIF which do \SetKwIf and
%                             \SetKwIfElseIf.The following default definition has been added:
%                             \SetKwIF{If}{ElseIf}{Else}{if}{then}{else if}{else}{endif}
%                             and so you get the macros;
%                             \If \eIf \lIf \uIf \ElseIf \uElseIf \lElseIf \Else \uElse \lElse
%                      * ADD: new macro \SetAlgoSkip which allow to fix the vertical skip before and after the
%                             algorithms. Default is smallskip, do \SetAlgoSkip{} if you don't want an extra space
%                             or \SetAlgoSkip{medskip} or \SetAlgoSkip{bigskip} if you want bigger space.
%                      * ADD: macro \SetKwIf defines in addition a new macro \uElse  (depending on wat name you
%                             have given in #2 arg).
%                      * ADD: macro \SetKwIfElseIf defines in addition a new macro \uElse and \ugElseIf (depending
%                             on what name you have given in #2 and #3 arg).
%                      * Change: baseline of algorithm is now top, so two algorithms can be put side by side.
%                      * FIX: Compatibility with color package solved. The problem was due to a redefinition of
%                             standard macros by color package. This solves compatibility problem with other
%                             packages as pstcol or colortbl. (notified by Dirk Fressmann, Antti Tarvainen and Koby
%                             Crammer)
%                      * Fix: extra little shift to the right with boxed style algorithm removed (notified by
%                             P. Tanovski)
%                      * Fix: algoln option was buggy (notified bye Jiaying Shen)
%                      * Fix: german and portuges option didn't work due to bad typo (notified by Martin Sievers,
%                             Thorsten Vitt and Jeronimo Pellegrini)

%   - February 13 2004 - revision 3.0 -
%                      * Major revision which makes the package independent from float.sty, so now
%                        - algorithm* works better, in particular can be used in multicols environments
%                        - (known bug corrected)
%                          [H] works now for all sort of environment but is handled differently for classic
%                          environment and star environment (algorithm, figure, procedure and function). For star
%                          environment, H acts like for classical figure environment, so it doesn't stay here
%                          absolutely.
%                        - (known bug corrected)
%                          you can use now floatflt package with algorithm package and even with figure
%                          option. Beware that if you want to put an algorithm inside a floatingfigure, it cannot
%                          be floating, so [H] is required and then figure option should not be used, since
%                          standard figure[H] are still floating with LaTeX.
%                      * boxruled: a new style added. Possible now since no style no more defined by the float
%                        package.
%                      * nocaptionofalgo: dosen't print Algorithm #: in the caption for algorithm in ruled or
%                        algoruled style.
%                        note: this is just documentation of a macro which was already in the package.
%   - December 14 2003 - revision 2.52 -
%                      * output message shorter
%                      * french keyword macro \PourTous was missing for longend option, it has been added.
%                      * TitleofAlgo prints Function or Procedure in corresponding environments.
%
%   - October 27 2003  - revision 2.51 - Revision submitted to CTAN archive
%                      * correction of a minor which make caption in procedure
%                        and function to be blanck with pdfscreen package
%                        (thanks to Joel Gossens for the notification)
%                      * add two internal definition to avoid some errors when
%                        used with Hyperref package (Hyperref package need to
%                        define new counter macro from existing ones, and
%                        don't do it for algorithm2e package, so we do it)
%
%   - October 17 2003  - revision 2.50 - first revision for CTAN archive
%                      * add \AlFnt and \SetAlFnt{font} macros: \AlFnt is used at the beginning of the caption and
%                        the body of algorithm in order to define the fonts used for typesetting algorithms. You
%                        can use it elsewhere you want to typeset text as algorithm. For example you can do
%                        \SetAlFnt{\small\sf} to have algorithms typeset in small sf font. Default is nothing so
%                        algorithm is typeset as the text of the document.
%                      * add \AlTitleFnt{text} and \SetAlTitleFnt{font} macros: The {Algorithm: } in the caption is
%                        typeset with \AlTitleFnt{Algorithm:}. You can use it to have text typeset as {Algorithm:}
%                        of captions. Default is textbf.  Default can be redefined by \SetAlTitleFnt{font}, for
%                        example you can do \SetAlTitleFnt{emph}
%                      * add CommentSty typo for text comment.  
%                      * add some compatibility with hyperref package (still an error on multiply defined refs but
%                        pdf correctly generated)
%                      * flush text to left in order to have correct indentation even with class as amsart which
%                        center all figures
%                      * add german, portuguese and czech options for title of algorithms and typo.
%                      * add portuguese translation of predefined keywords * add czech translation of some
%                        predefined keywords
%
%   - December 23 2002 - revision 2.40
%                      * add some french keyword missing
%                      * add function* and procedure* environment like algorithme* environment: print in one column
%                        even if twocolumn option is specified for the document.
%                      * add a new macro \SetKwComment to define macro which writes comments in the text. First
%                        argument is the name of the macro, second is the text put before the comment, third is the
%                        text put at the end of the comment.Default are \tcc and \tcp
%                      * add new options to change the way algo are numbered:
%                        [algopart] algo are numbered within part (counter must exist)
%                        [algochapter] algo are numbered within chapter
%                        [algosection] algo are numbered within section
%
%   - March 27 2002   - revision 2.39
%                      * Gilles Geeraerts: added the \SetKwIfElseIf to manage
%                        if (c)
%                             i;

%                        end
%                      * Also added \gIf \gElseIf \gElse.

%                      * bugs related to the caption in procedure and function
%                        environment are corrected.
%                      * bug related to option noend (extra vertical space added
%                        after block command as If or For) is corrected.
%                      * czech option language added (thanks to Libor Bus: l.bus@sh.cvut.cz).
%  
%   - October 16 2000 - revision 2.37
%                      * option algo2e added: change the name of environment
%                        algorithm into algorithm2e. So allow to use the package
%                        with some journal style which already define an algorithm
%                        environment.

%                      * option slide added: require package color
%                      * Hack for slide class in order to have correct

%   - November 25 1999 - revision 2.35
%                      * revision number match RCS number
%                      * Thanks to David A. Bader, a new option is added:
%                        noend: no end keywords are printed.
%  
%   - November 19 1999 - revision 2.32
%                      * minor bug on longend option corrected.
%  
%   - August 26 1999 - revision 2.31
%                      * add an option: figure
%                        this option makes algorithms be figure and so are numbered
%                        as figures, have Figure as caption and are put in 
%                        the \listoffigures
%  
%   - January 21 1999 - revision 2.3 beta
%                    add 2 new environments: procedure and function.
%                    These environments works like algorithm environment but:
%                    - the ruled (or algoruled) style is imperative.
%                    - the caption now writes Procedure name....
%                    - the syntax of the \caption command is restricted as
%                      follow: you MUST put a name followed by 2 braces like
%                      this ``()''. You can put arguments inside the braces and
%                      text after. If no argument is given, the braces will be
%                      removed in the title. 
%                    - label now puts the name (the text before the braces in the
%                      caption) of the procedure or function as reference (not
%                      the number like a classic algorithm environment).
%                    There are also two new styles: ProcNameSty and
%                    ProcArgSty. These style are by default the same as FuncSty
%                    and ArgSty but are used in the caption of a procedure or a
%                    function.
%                    
%   - November 28 1996 - revision 2.22
%                    add a new macro \SetKwInParam{arg1}{arg2}{arg3}:
%                    it defines a macro \arg1{name}{arg} which prints name in keyword
%                    style followed byt arg surrounded by arg2 and arg3. The main
%                    application is to a function working as \SetKwInput to be used
%                    in the head of the algorithm. For example
%                    \SetKwInParam{Func}{(}{)} allows
%                    \Func{functionname}{list of arguments} which prints:
%                    \KwSty{functioname(}list of arguments\KwSty{)}
%       
%
%   - November 27 1996 - revision 2.21:
%                    minor bug in length of InOut boxes fixed.
%                    add algorithm* environment.
%
%   - July 12 1996 - revision 2.2: \SetArg and \SetKwArg macros removed.
%                        
%                    \SetArg has been removed since it never has been
%                    documented.
%                    \SetKwArg has been removed since \SetKw can now
%                    take an argument in order to be consistent with
%                    \SetKwData and \SetKwFunction macros.
%
%   - July 04 1996 - revision 2.1: still more LaTeX2e! Minor compatibility break
%
%                    Macros use now \newcommand instead of \def, use of \setlength, 
%                    \newsavebox, ... and other LaTeX2e specific stuff.
%                    The compatibility break:
%                    - \SetData becomes \SetKwData to be more consistent. So the old 
%                      \SetKwData becomes \SetKwInput
%                    - old macros \titleofalgo, \Freetitleofalgo and \freetitleofalgo
%                      from LaTeX209 version which did print a warning message and call 
%                      \Titleofalgo in version 2.0 are now removed!

\def\algocf@longdef{\long\def}
%
% \algocf@newcommand (and helper \algocf@new@command) behaves like LaTeX's newcommand,
% with two differences:
%  - the argument is not "\<name>", but rather "<name>"; i.e. one level of indirection
%  - if the command exists already, then \renewcommand, rather than \newcommand

% \algocf@newcmdside<name><arity><body>
%   The largest time-saver; many commands we define have the pattern:
%     \<name>(<side_text>)<argX><argY>...
%   where "(<side_text>)" is optional. By defining them with this function,
%   the arguments are parsed and renumbered, i.e. the body works as if the
%   command was:
%     \<name><side_text><argX><argY>...
%   and can use \ifArgumentEmpty to see whether its #1 exists (default case
%   for the side text is (), so there's no difference between calling
%     \foo{bar}
%   or
%     \foo(){bar}
%   Technically this is new behaviour, but it shouldn't really occur...

%
% \algocf@newcmdsides<name><arity><body><tail><closing>
%   Like the command above, but with an optional side text at the end
%   of the command as well, i.e.:
%     \<name>(<side_text>)<argX><argY>(<end_text>)
%   It may be a bit confusing that <arity> doesn't count <end_text>,
%   but since it is for internal use, the naming can be a little more
%   fuzzy. This function behaves as if:
%     <body'> = <body><if end_text: tail{end_text}><closing>
